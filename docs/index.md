wide variety of libraries and applications, from simple utility libraries to complex composable
libraries and applications.

### Features

* Simple and efficient build process
* Flexible and extensible library structure
* Support for multiple publication formats (Maven, AAR, etc.)
* Automatic documentation generation

### Requirements

* Android Gradle Plugin 7.0+
* Kotlin Gradle Plugin 1.7+
