Winds aims to provide a simple and efficient way to build and publish libraries and applications for
multiple platforms. It is designed to be flexible and extensible, so that it can be used to build a
wide variety of libraries and applications, from simple utility libraries to complex composable
libraries and applications.

### Features

* Simple and efficient build process
* Flexible and extensible library structure
* Support for multiple publication formats (Maven, AAR, etc.)
* Automatic documentation generation

### How to Apply

**Plugin implementation**

To implement the Winds plugin, add the following plugin ID to your build.gradle file:

=== "Kotlin"

    ```kotlin
    plugins {
      id("dev.teogor.winds") version "1.0.2"
    }
    ```

=== "Groovy"

    ```groovy
    plugins {
      id 'dev.teogor.winds' version '1.0.2'
    }
    ```

To learn more about detailed implementation, please refer to the
comprehensive [documentation](releases.md).

### Usage

```kotlin
winds {
  buildFeatures {
    mavenPublish = true
    docsGenerator = true
  }

  mavenPublish {
    groupId = "my.group.id"
    artifactId = "my-library"
    version = "1.0.0"
  }
}
```

**Generating Documentation**

This project utilizes Gradle tasks to manage documentation generation.

**Running Documentation Generation:**

1. **Winds Markdown Task:**
   To generate documentation using the provided Markdown templates, execute the following command in
   your project's root directory:

   ```shell
   ./gradlew :windsMd
   ```

   This command runs the `windsMd` task, which processes the templates and generates the final
   documentation files.

**Updating Dates without Regeneration:**

In some scenarios, you might want to update timestamps within existing documentation without
regenerating the entire content. To achieve this, use the `forceDateUpdate` parameter with
the `windsMd` task:

   ```shell
   ./gradlew :windsMd -PforceDateUpdate=false
   ```

- **`-PforceDateUpdate=false`:** This parameter instructs the task to skip content regeneration and
  only update timestamps within the existing documentation. Setting it to `true` would normally
  force complete regeneration (not recommended for date updates).

**Generated Documentation Location:**

The generated documentation files will be located in the project's `docs/` directory. You can
access these files to view the project's API reference and other documentation.
